            Stop. Selling. Equity
          </h1>
          <div className={classes.description}>
            You are growing and your equity value is growing faster. Selling
            equity to raise capital is the most expensive form of capital when
            you are a growing company (thatâ€™s why VCs love it). Pando finance
            gives projects a cheaper alternative.

            Your choice
          </h1>
          <div className={classes.description}>
            You can choose to sell however much or however little based on your
            current capital needs. Need to extend your runway by a couple of
            months? Sure. Looking to raise enough to build out a 12-person team?
            No problem. You choose.
